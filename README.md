# Quantitative-3D-structural-analysis-of-the-cellular-microstructures
We developed a workflow for 3D structural analysis of the cellular microstructures. It provides free, open source tools for cellular materials geometry and shape analysis. Here we use sea urchin spine structure as a representative volume.
