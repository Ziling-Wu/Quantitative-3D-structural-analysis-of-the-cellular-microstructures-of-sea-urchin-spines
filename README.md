# Quantitative-3D-structural-analysis-of-the-cellular-microstructures
This repository will collect codes accompanying the publication: Quantitative 3D structural analysis of the cellular microstructures of sea urchin spines (I): Methodology. In this work, we developed a workflow for 3D structural analysis of the cellular microstructures. It provides free, open source tools for cellular materials geometry and shape analysis. Scripts need Matlab. Here we use sea urchin spine structure as a representative volume.

The main code is put in the folder 'Code' under this repository. By running the code step by step, we are able to analyze the cellular microstructure of open-cell foam.
