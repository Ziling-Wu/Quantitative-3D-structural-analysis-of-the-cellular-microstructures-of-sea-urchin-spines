# Quantitative-3D-structural-analysis-of-the-cellular-microstructures
This repository will collect codes accompanying the publication: Quantitative 3D structural analysis of the cellular microstructures of sea urchin spines (I): Methodology. In this work, we developed a workflow for 3D structural analysis of the cellular microstructures. It provides free, open source tools for cellular materials geometry and shape analysis. Scripts need Matlab. Here we use sea urchin spine structure as a representative volume.
